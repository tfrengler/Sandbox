In order to incorporate this in an existing project:

- You need the folder structure:
-- views/
-- controllers/
-- MVC/

- These things from Application.cfc:
-- The mappings
-- onApplicationStart()
-- onRequest()

LAYOUTS/VIEWS:

Need an OnMissingView() and OnMissingLayout() for the controllers
Need a GetView() on MVC

Need a "Layouts"-folder. These are the primary HTML-pages linked to a "section"
Layouts are the templates of the page, and each sub-element which is reusable on that page
(modules if you will) are the "Views", which are injected into
