# Sandbox

This is simply a repo for me dumping things I am testing and messing with at any given time:

**FileUploadTest (Javascript)**: My first attempts at messing with FormData, FileList and File. I was curious about front end file validation (file sizes) and posting files using AJAX.

**2dCanvasRenderingTest (Javascript)**: Not my first attempt at drawing things with Canvas but definitely my most ambitious. I was searching for ideas for HTML UI-elements, and somehow ended up trying to create a basic radial menu myself. At the same time I got to brush up on trigonometry, even though I am not sure my math is done equally well, but this just ended up being for fun anyway.

**PromiseTest (Javascript)**: My latest work, checking out Promises, which ended up being an ideal solution for a message queing system that ties in with jQuery-animations. It also has elements of the module pattern (simulating object private-properties), freezing object properties (protecting them) and using consts.
